# uk-areacodes-rust
A Rust port of [my Typescript UK areacodes lookup lib](https://github.com/eharrow/uk-areacodes).  The idea is that this will be used as the core of a [WASM build](https://github.com/eharrow/uk-areacodes-wasm) to be used from [a pipedreams JS pipeline](https://github.com/eharrow/pipedream-worflows).
